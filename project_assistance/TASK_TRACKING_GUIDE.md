## 🛠️ **Useful Commands for Task Tracking**

### **Check Current Status**
```bash
# Check if virtual environment is active
echo $env:VIRTUAL_ENV

# Check Python version
python --version

# Check CORE-NN version
python -c "import core_nn; print(core_nn.__version__)"
```

### **Run Quick Tests**
```bash
# Quick performance test
python -m core_nn.utils.profiling --quick

# Memory usage check
python benchmarks/run_memory_benchmark.py --quick

# Basic validation
python -m core_nn.cli validate --config-file configs/default.yaml
```

### **Update Task Progress**
```bash
# After completing a task, update the task list
# Then commit your progress
git add TASK_LIST.md
git commit -m "Completed Task X.X.X: [Task Description]"
```
